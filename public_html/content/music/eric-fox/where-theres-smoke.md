============================================

    Take the water from the well
    Pass it up the line
    Tell the preacher ring the bell
    His daughter's out tonight

    Hands will join together
    I'll take her's and she'll take mine

    Let the spirit take us higher
    Fan the flames of our desire
    Where there's smoke there's gonna' be fire

    Clear the stables while you can
    Set the horses free
    The daughter of a preacher man
    Comin' to rescue me

    There'll be rolling thunder
    Clouds are low but we're so high

    Let the spirit take us higher
    Fan the flames of our desire
    Where there's smoke there's gonna' be fire

    Hey baby let's get low
    Roll your body shake my soul
    Let me know your love is burning

    Spread your wings take me higher
    Fan the flames of our desire
    Where there's smoke there's gonna' be fire

    Tell me that you feel the same
    Stay with me tonight
    Together we will spark a flame
    Dance by fire light

    There'll be rolling thunder
    Clouds are low but we're so high

    Let the spirit take us higher
    Fan the flames of our desire
    Where there's smoke there's gonna' be fire

    Hey baby let's get low
    Roll your body shake my soul
    Let me know your love is burning

    Spread your wings take me higher
    Fan the flames of my desire
    Where there's smoke there's gonna' be fire

    Let the spirit take us higher
    Fan the flames of our desire
    Where there's smoke there's gonna' be fire
