Carry On
========

    These eyes have seen better days
    What once was clear is now clouded over
    You've found your resting place
    I lost my light to show me the way

    Carry on
    I will carry on
    Every day I keep on trying
    Carry on
    I will carry on
    Rise like the morning sunshine

    These lines in this old face
    They show the time that's now all gone
    Each night I lay awake
    Wondering if you're watching over

    Carry on
    I will carry on
    Every day I keep on trying
    Carry on
    I will carry on

    This heart still pounds like rain
    It drowns without the life you give it
    In time the pain will fade
    Like memories that I try to hold on to

    Carry on
    I will carry on
    Every day I keep on trying
    Carry on
    I will carry on
    Rise like the morning sunshine
