Bitter Wood
===========

    An old man took a piss on a tree
    And the tree began to grow
    Everyday that man walked by
    He would piss on it some more

    The tree grew taller as years went by
    Laced in leaves the color gold
    Not a single songbird in the sky
    Built it's nest in the branches below

    'Cause there's bitter wood growing inside
    Take a piss on a tree but don't you piss on me

    Now that tree was sixty-some feet tall
    Seven feet around it's trunk
    It's roots were all but rotten dry
    From all the piss that they had drunk

    And it's bitter wood growing inside
    Take a piss on a tree but don't you piss on me

    One day when the man came near
    About to piss right under a limb
    A gust of wind ripped through the sky
    Brought the tree down on top of him

    Well there's bitter wood growing inside
    Take a piss on a tree but don't you piss on me
