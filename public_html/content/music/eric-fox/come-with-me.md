Come With Me
============

Copyright &copy; 2010 Eric Fox

    I've been around this great big world alone
    I can't remember when I last saw home
    I'm searching for the man I use to know
    Driving hard, winter's blowing cold

    Won't you show me the way
    Back to yesterday

    You come with me
    Come with me
    I'll show you wonders

    Love won't be free
    Can't you see
    I'll make you wonder

    Hey Hey Hey
    Come with me
    To the world
    I will set you free
    Don't be afraid
    You're not alone
    To remember life without me

    To come with me
    Grab your things
    We'll leave tomorrow

    Love set you free
    Won't it be
    I'll make you wonder

    Hey Hey Hey
    Come with me
    To the world
    The edge of the sea
    Don't be afraid
    You're not alone
    To myself and you are born
