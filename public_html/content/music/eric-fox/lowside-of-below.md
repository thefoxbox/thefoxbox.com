Lowside Of Below
================

    Now I don't have no use for schmoozin', socials and fancy wine
    Don't want nobody tellin' me how and where to spend my time
    I wake up in the morning grab my smokes and bottle of gin
    Head out to the front porch and I start it all over again

    I'll be hangin' at the lowside of below
    Set the course for Hell and off I go
    I'll be hangin' at the lowside of below
    Whether I'm coming back I just don't know

    I never saw myself a family man, but the Lord knows I've tried
    I seem to recall that two romances were ended with prison time
    Now women, they like the truck I drive, I'll be damned if it don't run
    Climb on in you sweet little darlin' cause tonight you're the lucky one

    I'll be hangin' at the lowside of below
    Set the course for Hell and off I go
    I'll be hangin' at the lowside of below
    Whether I'm coming back I just don't know

    Some folks say what makes a man is the company that he keeps
    Others try to pin him down to where he eats, shits and sleeps
    Well I am just a good ol' boy with some demons I can't drown
    Good advice even given twice won't stop me from going down

    I'll be hangin' at the lowside of below
    Set the course for Hell and off I go
    I'll be hangin' at the lowside of below
    Whether I'm coming back I just don't know
