Belly Of An Ox
==============

    There once was a boy named Ryan Fox
    Who was stuck in the belly of a great big ox
    He wanted out he began to shout
    But no one heard him cry

    Aye-Ooo, Aye-Ooo
    Aye-Ooo, Aye-Ooo
    There once was a boy named Ryan Fox
    Who was stuck in the belly of an ox

    Along came a farmer who heard him cry
    He thought that boy was gonna' to die
    He grabbed his ax and began to hack
    Till the head of the ox fell off

    Aye-Ooo, Aye-Ooo
    Aye-Ooo, Aye-Ooo
    There once was a boy named Ryan Fox
    Who was stuck in the belly of an ox

    The farmer reached in and grabbed his chin
    He pulled him out from deep within
    When Ryan came out he said hooray
    I'm finally free today

    Aye-Ooo, Aye-Ooo
    Aye-Ooo, Aye-Ooo
    There once was a boy named Ryan Fox
    Who was stuck in the belly of an ox
