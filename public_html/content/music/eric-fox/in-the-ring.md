In The Ring
===========

Copyright &copy; 2010 Eric Fox

    Get in the ring
    Take a swing
    Feel the sting
    Try to make it out alive

    The bell will sound
    Another round
    Hit the ground
    Too much pain to survive

    Another hit
    Blood will spit
    Lights are lit
    Seeing stars up in your eyes

    Feel the pain
    Life hits hard and it doesn't quit
    There ain't no shame in walking away
    If the ring is going to take your life

    Put up your fist
    Take a risk
    Hit or miss
    You throw the best punch that you've got

    Stay on your feet
    Can't be beat
    Trowing heat
    Gotta' strike when the fire's hot

    Takin' blows
    Broken nose
    Heavy Toes
    Must have been a lucky shot

    Feel the pain
    Life hits hard and it doesn't quit
    There ain't no shame in walking away
    If the ring is going to take your life

    Pinned on the rope
    Ain't no joke
    There's no hope
    Seems as though you're losing time

    Going down
    Hit the ground
    Ringing sound
    Face the mat is where you lie

    The count to ten
    It's over then
    The towels tossed in
    Judgement day has finally arrived

    Feel the pain
    Life hits hard and it doesn't quit
    There ain't no shame in walking away
    If the ring is going to take your life
