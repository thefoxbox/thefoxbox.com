One-Eyed Man
============

    Dare to stare at the one-eyed man
    Save your soul if you can
    There's no use to run and hide
    He'll find you with his one good eye
    Take away a young man's pride
    He'll take away a young man's pride

    Hidden by the dark of night
    Filling people full of fright
    Searching for his missing eye
    He'll grab your body from behind
    Make or break a young girl's cry
    He'll make or break a young girl's cry

    Dare to stare at the one-eyed man
    Save your soul if you can
    There's no use to run and hide
    He'll find you with his one good eye
    Take away a young man's pride
    He'll take away a young man's pride
